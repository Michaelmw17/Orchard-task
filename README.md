# Orchard-task

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

[Deployed to Vercel Link](https://orchard-task.vercel.app/)

## Description

This is a very simple Next.js project. It is a single page application that renders the components from the [Orchard FED test Design](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main/default/#/console/16828396/348908478/preview).

Reasoning:

Tailwind CSS - For its mobile-first approach & custom styling can be provided to the components with the help of this framework, whilst eliminating the hassle of naming classes.

Next.js - It allows you to build both simple and complex web applications much faster and with the help of great frameworks, you can now build extremely fast websites to achieve a much better user experience and SEO efficiency.

React-Reval - Adds reveal animations using the Intersection Observer API to detect when the elements appear in the viewport.

Eslint - ESLint is the dominant tool for linting Node. js packages
